## Hi, I'm Anjali âœ¨

I'm a Master's student at LMU Munich. I really enjoy working with domain experts to create machine learning based solutions to their problems. I like exploring different fields because I think each one comes with some challenges, and I learn the most when I am faced with these challenges.

I also believe that AI/ML models are powerful tools, and helping people from different domains use these technologies is fulfilling for me. So, I make conscious efforts to find opportunities where I get to push myself to learn, apply what I know, and contribute, with an attempt to always keep my learning curve in an increasing trend. 

Some things I have worked/am working on are:
- **Graph Neural Networks** -> I am using GNNs to detect functional subcircuits (e.g., Sbox, key expansion) in digital circuit netlists. This is a part of my master's thesis.
- **Low-Resource ML** -> I collaborated with a historian to build a handwritten text model for 18th and 19th century manuscripts to enable automatic transcriptions (repo to be released soon!)
- more to come ...
